# Intro-to-Time-Series-Analysis-in-R

# Coursera guided project learning and practicing time series analysis in R. Course taught by Vinod Bakthavachalam.

# Coursera's description of course:

"In this 2 hour long project-based course, you will learn the basics of time series analysis in R. By the end of this project, you will understand the essential theory for time series analysis and have built each of the major model types (Autoregressive, Moving Average, ARMA, ARIMA, and decomposition) on a real world data set to forecast the future. We will go over the essential packages and functions in R as well to make time series analysis easy."
